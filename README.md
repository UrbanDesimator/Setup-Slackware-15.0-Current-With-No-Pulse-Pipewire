Information and config guide to use Slackware-15.0/Current with no pulseaudio or pipewire. Using  Alsa and Jackd

Slackware is a registered trade mark of Patrick volkerding.

I am eternaly grateful for Slackware and proud to have used it continually since 1998. It changed my life being  dyslexic, but I instantly felt at home with the setup configuration base philosophy's behind it. There is no such thing as a free lunch work for it, I've never stopped learning with Slackware. And have amazed myself and other's with the achievements I have made. UrbanMusic

Welcome, Here is how I setup Slackware-15.0+ Current Sound using Alsa for sound without pulseaudio or pipewire. Including my setup of jack audio connection kit for audio recording creation and production. And still be able to use desktop apps including browsers and youtube, at the same time.
This is an ongoing journey and I will use directories for the steps.

1, Slackware system setup package removal and package rebuilds that were needed.
2, config files for alsa and jackd setup
3, SBo build's
4, external programs I used
